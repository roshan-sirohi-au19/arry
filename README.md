Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive error handling to handle situations where elements are not found or the website structure changes. For example, use try-catch blocks to gracefully handle errors.

Selector Flexibility: Used CSS selectors more flexible to adapt to potential changes in the website's structure. Used more generic selectors that are less likely to break when the website layout changes.

Headless Mode: Considered using Puppeteer in headless mode (without a visible browser window) for stealth and resource efficiency. This will reduce the chances of detection by the website.
